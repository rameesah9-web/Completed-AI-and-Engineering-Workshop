AI and Engineering Workshop (2025)

What it was

A beginner workshop introducing AI and how it connects to engineering. It was aimed at school leavers like me, so nothing too advanced.
What I did/learned

Basics of AI:
What machine learning is (computers learning from data), how it's different from normal programming. Saw examples like chatbots (ChatGPT style) or image recognition.
Engineering side: How AI gets built into real products (like apps or tools), simple problem-solving with tech.
Hands-on stuff:
Probably tried prompt engineering (writing good questions for AI) or no-code tools to make something basic work.
Ethical and non-ethical part: Talked about good vs bad use of AI. Ethical = fair, transparent, no bias (e.g., not discriminating people). Non-ethical = things like deepfakes, privacy invasion, or biased decisions.
 humans vs AI: AI is really good at patterns and speed, but it can't feel emotions, understand context like people, or have real creativity/morality. Humans make the decisions – AI is just a tool.

Why it matters for me:

It showed me AI isn't magic – it's engineering + data. Got me thinking about using AI safely in IT (e.g., helping with troubleshooting without replacing people). Made me want to learn more for apprenticeship.
Screenshots to take (if you have access)

A slide or note page from the session (if you saved any).

What everything means (simple explanation)

Machine learning: Computers get better by seeing lots of examples (like recognising cats in photos).
Ethical AI: Making sure AI doesn't hurt people (no bias against groups, no lying/deepfakes).
Non-ethical AI: Misuse like fake news videos or spying without permission.
Humans vs AI: AI copies patterns super fast but has no feelings, conscience, or true understanding – it can copy human writing but doesn't "think" or "feel" like us.
